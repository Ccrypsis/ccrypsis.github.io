### InsightBoard - Rethinking Employee Feedback
[Artifact](https://github.com/Ccrypsis/InsightBoard) 

[Pitch/Demo](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TkWyY4RRbUriOxdPkLdpftpb9Pln6G13D3XdUfW9h3c/edit)

A web application designed to help organizations gather honest and actionable employee feedback in a more engaging way. Inspired by the familiar Reddit-style interface, it allows employees to submit feedback anonymously, vote on others’ suggestions, and highlight issues or ideas that matter most to them.

The platform includes separate dashboards for both employees and administrators. Employees can post, comment, and engage with others’ feedback, while administrators can review submissions, approve or deny posts, and track trending topics to identify workplace priorities.

Built using Agile and Scrum methodologies, the project focused on creating a user-friendly interface, integrating multiple backend entry points into a cohesive system, and ensuring smooth functionality through thorough testing. The final result is a collaborative tool that encourages open communication and fosters continuous improvement within an organization.
